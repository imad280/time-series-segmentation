# time-series-segmentation
This repository regroups all of the works and all the methods (novel ones too) that I had the chance to work on in the context of Time Series Segmentation (TSS).<b>

<ul><b>Latent-variable Time-varying Graphical Lasso (LTGL):</b></ul> This method measures in a graphical way the interactions between the variables of a multivariate time serie throughout time while considering the effect of latent variables. Here is the link of the paper: <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.03987.pdf">LTGL</a>. An application of this method on an example dataset is the content of the correspendent notebook.
<ul><b>Classification Score Profile (ClaSP):</b></ul> This method solves the problem of Change Point Detection (CPD) in a novel way that is parameter-free and domain-agnostic. The link to the paper: <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.13987.pdf">ClaSP</a>
